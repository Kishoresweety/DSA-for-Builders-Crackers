# 📘 “DSA for Builders & Crackers” – Crack FAANG & Build Systems with Confidence




---

📦 Phase 0: Foundation Setup (Week 0)

Before touching DSA, we do:

✅ Choose Language (C or Python or Rust? — We'll pick what's best for you)

✅ Set Up Editor + Local Practice + Mobile-compatible flow

✅ Learn Input/Output basics + debugging methods

✅ Track Your Growth — I’ll add mini-journal templates and personal best tracking

🧠 Phase 1: Core Concepts (Weeks 1–2)

Topic	What You’ll Learn	Why It’s Unique

Variables & Loops	How memory works, visual tracing	No skipping logic — all with visual metaphors
Arrays & Strings	Build intuition on memory layout	We’ll do real tasks like URL shortener, media gallery manager
Functions & Recursion	Brain-train approach to recursion	No confusion, just step-by-step puzzle building


✅ At the end: Code your own calculator, file manager, or custom notepad.


---

🌲 Phase 2: Core Data Structures (Weeks 3–5)

DS	What You’ll Master	Real Projects

Stack & Queue	Undo-redo system, Task manager	AI chat history handler
Linked List	Build your own music player	Real-world memory editor
HashMap	Build login/session store	Design your own database
Trees & Tries	Build directory system, AI autocomplete	File explorer clone
Graphs	GPS simulation, social network logic	Game map pathfinder


✅ I’ll give visual animations, mobile-compatible diagrams, and real-world coding tasks after every topic.

⚔️ Phase 3: Algorithms & FAANG Patterns (Weeks 6–10)

Category	What You’ll Learn	Practice Approach

Sorting & Searching	Binary search patterns	System-level search engine clone
Recursion & Backtracking	Sudoku solver, Maze solver	Useful for AI/Quantum
Dynamic Programming	No scary math — only visual state diagrams	Projects like Resume Optimizer
Greedy & Sliding Window	Performance tricks for scalable systems	Ad system simulator
Graph Algorithms	Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, A*	Build Uber-like routing system


✅ Bonus: Every pattern will have a "FAANG-ready problem set" with hints, solution plan, and mock code.

🏗️ Phase 4: Build-While-You-Learn (Ongoing)

We will combine DSA + Systems Building like this:

System Project	Concepts Used

AI Resume Parser	Hashing, String Matching, Trees
Personal ChatBot	Stack, Queue, Graph
File Organizer	Trie, DFS
Quantum Sudoku	Backtracking, Matrix
Skill Roadmap AI	Graph + DP



---

💡 Phase 5: Mock Interview Preparation (Optional but Recommended)

Round	Focus

Round 1	Warm-up, walk-through thinking
Round 2	System + Code combo (Real-world)
Round 3	FAANG-style timed problems
Round 4	Live debugging + edge case discussion
